"""Orchestrator for the evaluation pipeline.

This module exposes an `Evaluator` class that coordinates ingestion,
execution, comparison and reporting. The implementation below focuses on
clarity and small, testable steps. Methods are implemented as thin
wrappers around the respective service classes so they can be mocked in
tests or replaced via dependency injection.
